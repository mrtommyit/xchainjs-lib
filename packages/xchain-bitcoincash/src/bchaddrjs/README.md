### ðŸ“¦ Note on BCH Address Utilities

This project replaces the original [`bchaddrjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bchaddrjs) [`code`](https://github.com/ealmansi/bchaddrjs) dependency with a direct copy of its source code included in the repository. The decision was made to avoid unnecessary bundle size inflation caused by the original package's inclusion of outdated polyfills. Functionality remains unchanged, and only the delivery method has been optimized for modern environments.
